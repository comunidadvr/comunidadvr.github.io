## Installation & Setup

1. Create the following pages if they do not exist already (or change the extension of existing markdown files from `.md` to `.html`):

   * `index.html` - set to `layout: home`
   * `about.html` - set to `layout: page`
   * `contact.html` - set to `layout: page`
   * `posts/index.html` - set to `layout: page` (you will also need to create a `posts` directory)

2. Configure the `index.html` front matter. Example:

    ```markdown
    ---
    layout: home
    background: '/PATH_TO_IMAGE'
    ---
    ```

3. Configure the `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `posts/index.html` front matter. Example:

    ```markdown
    ---
    layout: page
    title: Page Title
    description: This is the page description.
    background: '/PATH_TO_IMAGE'
    ---
    ```

4. For each post in the `_posts` directory, update the front matter. Example:

    ```markdown
    ---
    layout: post
    title: "Post Title"
    subtitle: "This is the post subtitle."
    date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
    background: '/PATH_TO_IMAGE'
    ---
    ```

6. Build your site: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
